You are auditing my 1a1 deliverables for a food delivery system.

**Task:** Do a rigorous gap analysis guided by this rubric:
- Coverage across stakeholders (Admin, Restaurant, Courier, Customer, Regulator, Tax/Payments, Support)
- Health compliance (FDA Food Code; allergen, temperature, cross-contact)
- Taxes & Fees (prepared food tax, marketplace facilitator, fee caps, bag fees, delivery zones)
- Data & UX (receipts, disclosures before purchase, export for audits, language accessibility)
- Traceability (stakeholder → requirement → test case, bidirectional)

**Output:**
- A table of 20–30 gaps with fields: Area, Gap, Impact, Evidence (quote/citation from your docs), Fix (specific)
- 3 *highest risk* gaps with proposed Mitigations
- A short test plan outline to verify the fixes
