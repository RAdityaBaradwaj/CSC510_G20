# Community & Outreach

We keep collaboration transparent so users, partners, and graders can track progress.

## Discussion channels

- **Discord (private):** Weekly summaries copied to GitHub Issues under the label `update`. Poster includes QR code linking to the invite (`proj2/docs/poster.pdf`).
- **GitHub Discussions:** `Announcements` category used for release notes and sprint recaps; each tagged with the corresponding version.
- **Mailing list:** `team@routedash.dev` forwards to all team members (Google Group, multi-owner).

## Public metrics

| Metric | Where to find it | Cadence |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Active installs (Expo Go) | README “Telemetry” badge (coming soon) | Weekly |
| Closed issues & PRs | GitHub Insights dashboard | Rolling |
| User success stories | `proj2/docs/repository-rubric.md` Case studies section | Per release |

## Partners & collaborators

- **NCSU Entrepreneurship Garage** – Providing user testing lab time.
- **Local Raleigh restaurants (beta)** – Two merchants committed for pilot (names redacted until contracts signed).
